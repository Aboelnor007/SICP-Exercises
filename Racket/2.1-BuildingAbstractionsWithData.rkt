; Chapter 2 - Building Abstractions with Data

; Chapter 1 was focused on computational processes and the role of procedures in program design. We saw how
; to use primitive data (numbers) and primitive operations (arithmetic operations), how to combine procedures 
; to form compond procedures through composition, continionals adn the use of parameters.

; In chapter two we are going to look at more complex data. Chapter 1 was about building abstractions by
; combining procedures to form compound procedures, we turn in this chapter to another key aspect of any
; programming language: the means it provides for building abstractions by combining data objects to form
; combound data

; Why do we want combound data in a programming language?
; - to elevate the conceptual level at which we can design our programs
; - to increase the modularity of our designs
; - enhance expressive power
